## 🛠️ About Me

I am a **full-stack web developer** specializing in the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** with a strong interest in creating responsive, user-focused, and performance-driven applications. I enjoy translating ideas into functional digital products while maintaining clean code, scalable architecture, and smooth user experiences.

My interest in programming grew from a curiosity about how systems work and evolved into a passion for **problem-solving, data structures, and full-stack development**. Over time, I have progressed from building basic webpages to developing complete full-stack applications with real-world use cases.
